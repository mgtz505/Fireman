# Fireman
A fun little word game for two players! I created this game to reflect on the HTML/CSS/JS skills I've developed thus-far. The game instructions can be found in the modal on the left side of the page.

## Game Overview
https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/34057/files/e2614a00-769a-11eb-8182-f6577f978a40"

- Fireman is a simple word game for two players, both of whom need to be sitting at the computer. Player one selects a word, the mystery word, which player two must then deduce to win the game. Player two has a guess for each letter in the word, plus several additional guesses which are determined by a difficulty calibration, The calibration is selected when player one chooses their word; five being the easiest (five additional guesses atop one for each letter in the word), one proving to be the most challenging (only one additional guess, yikes). 
- For each letter in the mystery word, a yellow box is generated. When a correct letter is guessed by player two, the corresponding box will populate with the letter. Incorrect guesses do not register, making this a game of memory as well as deduction.
- An alert will communicate to both players that the word has been successfully deduced. If player two is not successful, a "game-over" message is displayed. For either outcome, an animation plays.

## List of Technologies used

* This project was coded with HTML, CS and JavaScript. I did some rudimentary design using Figma for the building PVG. The flame is pixel art I found online. 

## User Stories for this Project

- As a game player, I need to see that I am able to guess individual letters and that my correct guesses are registered by the game.
- As a game player, I need to see that the game remembers my letter choices for each subsequent turn.
- As a game player, I need to see, on a basic level, that the visual element representing a successful outcome is alterred in some capacity.
- As a game player, I need to have a winning condition; in this instance, successfully guessing the mystery word. A message or alert should be displayed alerting me that I have lost.
- As a game player, I need to have a losing condition; in this instance, when I run out of guesses. A message or alert should be displayed alerting me that I have lost.
